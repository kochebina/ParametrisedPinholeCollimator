!!!Important!!!
Do not forget to adapt this simple script at lines 16, 22 and 27
16: your input .hispect file
22: your rotation radius
27: thickness of your collimator

We decided to keep this script as simple as possible and not introduce the previous parameters as input options, thus, the script doesn't need a compilation.
And most probably will be used for inspiration.

To run:
root -l HiSPECTtoGate.C
